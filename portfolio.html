                <p> My first big project that I had while attending FullStack Academy was creating a Zoo html page. This project was to help me practice and show off what I learned about HTML. The requirements for the project were:</p>

                    <li> Include a main header that describes the purpose of the page </li>
                   <li> Include a title for the browser tab </li>
                   <li> Include a heading for each of the animals</li>
                   <li> Add the animal names in a list format </li>

                <h2> Project 2 </h2>
                <p> My second big project that I had done while attending FullStack Academy was creating a simple grocery list. This project was to help me practice and show off what I learned about css as well as expand my knowledge of HTML. The requirements for the project were: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Incorporate major HTML semantic tags </li>
                    <li> Each category of grocery should be in some type of "section" </li>
                    <li> Sections should have background colors </li>
                    <li> Section headers should have background colors </li>
                    <li> The main header text needs to be a different color </li>
                    <li> Use three types of headings </li>
                    <li> Include two types of lists </li>
                    <li> Use the box model to add borders and spacing to each section </li>
                    <li> Add two photos with padding so it is nicely spaced away from the text element </li>
                    <li> CSS needs to be incorporated using an external CSS file, internal in the header, and inline. I could choose which CSS goes where </li>

                <h2> Project 3 </h2>
                <p> The third project that I had to do while attending FullStack Academy was to create a pop up message using JavaScript. This was a way to show off what I head learned about JavaScript. The requirements for this project were: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Write the pseudocode of your steps and how you will solve this exercise.
                    <li> Create a string for the user saying: You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination: </li>
                    <li> Assign three variables. Each variable contains the corresponding result of calculation using a unique arithmetic operator(+-*/). Each must equal one of the three codes in the combination. </li>
                    <li> Add comments throughout the code to explain each step in the process. </li>
                    <li> Create a dialog box displaying the vault codes and the text if using HTML and a script tag, or create a popup dialog. </li>
                </ul>
